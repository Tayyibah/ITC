<h1>How google recrawls your url’s: </h1>
                          <a href=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6065812?hl=en>(url: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/)<a>
<p>If you’ve recently made changes to a URL on your site, you can update your web page in Google Search with the Submit to Index function of the Fetch as Google tool. This function allows you to ask Google to crawl and index your URL. </p>
<p>Before you submit a URL, you might want to fetch (or fetch and render) it first to diagnose and debug any crawling or rendering errors with the page. Once Fetch as Google finishes processing your fetch, you can click Submit to Index to notify Google that your URL is ready to be re-crawled. Note that this function appears only if your fetch meets these criteria: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your fetch must have a complete, partial, or redirected fetch status. </li>
<li>Your fetch must use the Desktop or Mobile Smartphone Googlebot type .</li>
<li>Your fetch cannot be more than 4 hours old.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google crawls and indexes the URL content as it is, after you click Submit. If you change the contents of a URL that has a pending submit request, your re-crawling results can differ from your current Fetch as Google results. Also, since Google re-crawls your page after you submit it, it doesn’t matter if the URL you submit was fetched with Fetch as Google with or without rendering. </p>
<p>Start the submit process by clicking Submit to Index to open a dialog in which you can request for Google to re-crawl and re-index your URL by following the steps below. </p>
<h3>Ask Google to crawl and index your URL</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click Submit to Index, shown next the status of a recent, successful fetch in the Fetches Table. </li>

<li>Select Crawl only this URL to submit one individual URL to the Google for re-crawling. You can submit up to 500 individual URLs per week in this way.</li>
<li>Select Crawl this URL and its direct links to submit the URL as well as all the other pages that URL links to for re-crawling. You can submit up to 10 of requests of this kind per month. </li>
<li>Click Submit to let Google know that your request is ready to be processed. </li>
</ol>
<p>Once you submit your URL, you might need to wait some time for Google to process your request as well as crawl and index the page. Also, understand that we can't guarantee that Google will index all your changes as Google relies on a complex algorithm to update indexed materials</p>
<h3>Change Googlebot crawl rate: </h3>
                        <a href= https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/48620?hl=en>(url: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/48620?hl=en)</a>
<p>Crawl rate refers to the speed of Googlebot's requests during the crawl process. It doesn't have any effect on how often we crawl or how deeply we crawl your URL structure. If you want Google to crawl new or updated content on your site, use Fetch as Google instead.</p>
<p>Google has sophisticated algorithms that determine how much to crawl each site. Our goal is to crawl as many pages from your site as we can on each visit without overwhelming your server's bandwidth. </p>
<p>If Google is crawling your site too often, and slowing down your server, you can change the crawl rate (the time used by Googlebot to crawl the site) for sites that are at the root level—for example, www.example.com andhttp://subdomain.example.com. Changing the crawl rate can cause some problems (for example, Google will not be able to crawl at a faster rate than the custom rate you set), so don't do this unless you are noticing specific problems caused by Googlebot accessing your servers too often. </p>
<p>You can't change the crawl rate for sites that are not at the root level—for example, www.example.com/folder. </p>
<h3>Change the crawl rate: </h3>
<ol>
</li>On the Webmaster Tools Home page, click the site you want.</li>
</li>Click the gear icon  , then click Site Settings.</li>
</li>In the Crawl rate section, select the option you want.</li>
</ol>
<p>The new crawl rate will be valid for 90 days. </p>
 
<h3>How to build the best keyword list: </h3>
                                       <a href= https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2453981?> (url: https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/)</a>
<p>Selecting the right keyword list for your campaign can help you show your ads to the customers you want as they search for specific terms or visit certain websites. Your keywords should match the terms your potential customers would use to find your products or services. </p>
<h4>Basic tips: Choosing and organizing your keywords</h4>
<ol> 
<li>Think like a customer when you create your list. </li>
<li>Write down the main categories of your business and the terms or phrases that might fall under each of those categories. </li>
 <li>Include terms or phrases your customers would use to describe your products or services. </li>
</ol>
<h4>Intermediate tips: Using the Keyword Planner, negative keywords, and the search terms report</h4>
<ol>
<li> Use the Keyword Planner to find and select new keywords.</li>
<li> Improve your click through rate with negative keywords.</li>
<li> Use the search terms report to further improve your keyword list.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Advanced tips: Using keyword match types and choosing keywords for the Display Network</h4>
<ol>
<li> Use keyword match types to better control who sees your ads.</li>
<li> Choose keywords that relate to the websites your customers see.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Add, edit, or remove your keywords: </h3>
<a href= url: https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/2453980>(url: https://support.google.com/adwords/answer)<a>
<p>You can help increase your sales and lower your costs by adding, changing, or removing keywords, their match type, their bid, and more. For example, let's say your campaign has been running for a while and your performance data shows that some of your keywords are performing better than others. You could increase your bids for keywords that are performing well and decrease your bids for keywords that aren't converting to sales. You could also make changes to your lowest-performing keywords to better reach your advertising goals, because high-quality, relevant keywords can help you show your ads to the customers you want, when you want. </p>

<h3>Add keywords: </h3>

<p>The steps for adding keywords to your ad group vary depending on whether your campaign type is "Search Network only," "Search Network with Display Select," "Search & Display Networks," or the "Display Network only." If you’re not sure what your campaign type is, you can find it by clicking the Campaigns tab, selecting the campaign you’d like to check, and looking at “Type” under your campaign name.</p>
<p>Add keywords to campaigns ("Search Network only," "Search Network with Display Select," or "Search & Display Networks")</p>
<p>Add keywords to campaigns targeting the Display Network only</p>

<h3>Edit, pause, or enable keywords:</h3>
<p>You can instantly edit a single keyword, or edit keywords in bulk. It's important to remember that when you edit the keyword itself or the keyword match type, you're removing the original keyword and creating a new one. Also, the statistics your keyword has accumulated will be reset to zero.</p>
<h3>Remove your keywords:</h3>
<p>You can remove a single keyword or multiple keywords in an ad group.</p>
