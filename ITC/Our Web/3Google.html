<p> Google Search, commonly referred to as Google Web Search or just Google, is a web search engine owned by Google Inc. It is the most-used search engine on the World Wide Web,] handling more than three billion searches each day</p>
                                                                                            
<h3>Development of Google: </h3>
<p>Started in 1998 as a university project by Stanford University students Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google is now the dominant search engine by no small margin and that didn't evolve slowly.</p>
<p>In fact, in June of 1999 Netscape Search was updated and AOL/Netscape search began to be powered by Google bringing their search volume to approximately 3 million per day; huge for the time.</p>
<p>On June 26,  2000 Yahoo Selected Google to provide its organic search results (replacing Inktomi) with its impressive index of more than 25 million pages; again, huge for the time. , Google replaced Inktomi as the provider of search results to Yahoo! and later AOL and Netscape. Even though Yahoo! broke away from Google in 2004, its market share has continued to grow to account for about 70 percent of all web searches. Google’s market share has steadily increased over the years.
Google has since become synonymous with the word "search" and as most of us know, is often used in place of the word. Don't know the answer? Google it!</p>

<h3>Place of Google today:</h3>
<p>Today Google is the largest public Internet search engine, in terms of indexed content and number of users. Company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin initially collaborated on a search engine called Back Rub that had the capability to analyze the back links pointing to a given Web site. With financial backing, in 1998 the founders opened Google. By 2000 Google was handling more than 100 million search queries a day, and by 2004 Google claims the site index reached 4.28 billion Web pages.
</p>
<h3>Short summary of google:</h3>
 <p>Google's search engine crawler, called the Google Bot, travels from Web page to Web page following hyperlinks. When a new page is found, Google bot will also crawl all the hyperlinks on that page as well. A second bot also crawls indexed pages to keep the index updated. As pages are indexed, they are also given scores based on criteria like how many times words are displayed (density), link popularity, HTML code, themes, content (the text) and more. These scores are what determines where the Web page listing appears in the search results.</p>
<p>Google also offers content-specific searches for Blogs, Books, Video, Images, Maps, Local, Mobile and country-specific searches. It is much more than search. It's blogging, mapping, hopping, research and more. Use this Webopedia Google Products & Services Quick Reference to get a grip on Google and its many services.
</p>
<h3>Google Features:</h3>
<p>Following are the features of google:</p>
<h3>PageRank:</h3>
<p>Google's rise to success was in large part due to a patented algorithm called PageRank that helps rank web pages that match a given search string. The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important. The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages, based on the weighted sum of the PageRanks of the pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance indicators.
</p>
<h3>Search products:</h3>
<p>The exact percentage of the total of web pages that Google indexes is not known, as it is very difficult to accurately calculate. Google presents a two-line summary and also a preview of each search result, which includes a link to a cached (stored), usually older version of the page.</p>
<h3>Universal search:</h3>
<p>Universal search was launched by Google on May 16, 2007. It was an idea which merged the results from different searches into one. Prior to Universal search, a standard Google search would consist of links to different websites. Universal search incorporates a wide variety of information such as websites, news, pictures, maps, blogs, videos, and more to display as search results. Marissa Mayer, VP of Search Products & User Experience during Universal search launch, described the goal of universal search, "With Universal search, we're attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results… We want to help you find the very best answer, even if you don't know where to look." </p>
<h3>Functionality:</h3>
<center><img src="32.jpg"/></center>
 
<p>Google search consists of a series of localized websites. The largest of those, the google.com site, is the top most-visited website in the world. Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words, the number of results you got on your search, links to other searches (e.g. for words that Google believes to be misspelled, it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling), and many more.</p>
<h3>Search syntax:</h3>
<p>Google's search engine normally accepts queries as a simple text, and breaks up the user's text into a sequence of search terms, which will usually be words that are to occur in the results. 
Query expansion</p>
<p>Google applies query expansion to the submitted search query, transforming it into the query that will actually be used to retrieve results. As with page ranking, the exact details of the algorithm Google uses are deliberately obscure, but certainly the following transformations are among those that occur:</p>
<ul type="circle" style="colour:blue">
<li><p style="color:blue">	Term reordering: in information retrieval this is a standard technique to reduce the work involved in retrieving results. This transformation is invisible to the user, since the results ordering uses the original query order to determine relevance.</li></p>
<li><p style="color:blue">Stemming is used to increase search quality by keeping small syntactic variants of search terms.  </li></p>
<li><p style="color:blue">There is a limited facility to fix possible misspellings in queries.</li></p>
<br>
</ul>

<h3>"I'm Feeling Lucky": </h3>
<p>Google's homepage includes a button labeled "I'm Feeling Lucky". Prior to a change in 2012 when a user typed in a search and clicked on the button the user would be taken directly to the first search result, bypassing the search engine results page. The idea was that if a user is "feeling lucky", the search engine would return the perfect match the first time without having to page through the search results. According to a study by Tom Chavez of "Rapt", this feature cost Google $110 million a year as 1% of all searches use this feature and bypass all advertising.</p>
<p>With the introduction of Google Instant, the functionality of the button behaves differently. Currently, the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button changes based on your settings and what webpage you are at. If Google Instant is turned off, the button will direct to the Google Doodles gallery. If Google Instant is turned on and a user hovers over the button, the button text will spin and land on a phrase that starts with "I'm feeling" (e.g. "I'm feeling hungry" or "I'm feeling smart"). Each phrase links to a Google service related to the associated phrase.</p>
<p>Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox used Lucky Search as the default search string when the user entered a query in the location bar; this functionality was deprecated in later versions.</p>
<h3>Special features:</h3>
<p>Besides the main search-engine feature of searching for text, Google Search has more than 22 "special features" </p>

<h3>Google Doodles:</h3>
<p>On certain occasions, the logo on Google's webpage will change to a special version, known as a "Google Doodle". This is a picture, drawing, or animation that includes the logo. It is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known.  Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic. The first was a reference to the Burning Man Festival in 1998, and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like Albert Einstein, historical events like the interlocking Lego block's 50th anniversary and holidays like Valentine's Day. </p>
<h3>Instant Search: </h3>


<center><img src="33.jpg"/></center>
 





<p>Google Instant, displaying a search of the term "google search", having autocompleted suggestions. The first on the list also appears in the search box itself, but the rest of the search keys which weren't written by the user appear in grey color. </p>
 


<h3>Mobile APP: </h3>
<p>A Google Search mobile app is available for Android and iOS devices. In addition to allowing users to perform web searches, the app implements Google Now, Google's voice recognition and intelligent personal assistant software. Google Now uses a natural language user interface to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of web services. Along with answering user-initiated queries, Google Now passively delivers information to the user that it predicts they will want, based on their search habits. Google Search for Android was originally introduced in 2007, the same year the Android operating system was introduced. On January 11, 2012, Google introduced an update where they included an updated and simplified user interface, along with other improvements. </p>
<h3>International: </h3>
<p>Google is available in many languages and has been localized completely or partly for many countries. </p>
<p>The interface has also been made available in some languages for humorous purpose: </p>	
<ul>
<li>Bork, bork, bork! </li>
<li>Elmer Fudd</li>
<li>Klingon</li>
<li>Leetspeak</li>
<li>Pig Latin</li>
<li>Pirate</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the main URL Google.com, Google Inc. owns 160 domain names for each of the countries/regions in which it has been localized. </p>
<h3>Search products: </h3>
<p>In addition to its tool for searching webpages, Google also provides services for searching images, Usenet newsgroups, news websites, videos, searching by locality, maps, and items for sale online. In 2012, Google has indexed over 30 trillion web pages, and received 100 billion queries per month. It also caches much of the content that it indexes. Google operates other tools and services including Google News, Google Shopping, Google Maps, Google Custom Search, Google Earth, Google Docs, Picasa, , YouTube, Google Translate, Google Blog Search and Google Desktop Search. </p>
<p>There are also products available from Google that are not directly search-related. Gmail, for example, is a webmail application, but still includes search features;Google Browser Sync does not offer any search facilities, although it aims to organize your browsing time. </p>
.
<h3>Google APPS for Work: </h3>
                                                                                         <a href= “From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia”>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>
<p>Google Apps for Work (formerly Google Apps for Business) is a suite of cloud computing productivity and collaboration software tools and software offered on a subscription basis by Google. </p>
<p>It includes Google’s popular web applications including Gmail, Google Drive, Google Hangouts, Google Calendar, and Google Docs.
