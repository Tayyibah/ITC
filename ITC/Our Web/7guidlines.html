<h1>Webmaster Guidelines </h1>

<h3>Best practices to help Google find, crawl, and index your site: </h3>
<p>Following these guidelines will help Google find, index, and rank your site. Even if you choose not to implement any of these suggestions, we strongly encourage you to pay very close attention to the "Quality Guidelines," which outline some of the illicit practices that may lead to a site being removed entirely from the Google index or otherwise impacted by an algorithmic or manual spam action. If a site has been affected by a spam action, it may no longer show up in results on Google.com or on any of Google's partner sites. </p>

<h4>When your site is ready:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Submit it to Google at http://www.google.com/submityourcontent/.</li>
<li>Submit a Sitemap using Google Webmaster Tools. Google uses your Sitemap to learn about the structure of your site and to increase our coverage of your webpages.</li>
<li>Make sure all the sites that should know about your pages are aware your site is online.</li>
<h3>Design and content guidelines: </h3>
<li>Make a site with a clear hierarchy and text links. Every page should be reachable from at least one static text link. </li>
<li>Offer a site map to your users with links that point to the important parts of your site. If the site map has an extremely large number of links, you may want to break the site map into multiple pages. </li>
<li>Keep the links on a given page to a reasonable number. </li>
<li>Create a useful, information-rich site, and write pages that clearly and accurately describe your content. </li>
<li>Think about the words users would type to find your pages, and make sure that your site actually includes those words within it. </li>
<li>Try to use text instead of images to display important names, content, or links. The Google crawler doesn't recognize text contained in images. If you must use images for textual content, consider using the ALT attribute to include a few words of descriptive text.</li>

<li>Make sure that your <title> elements and ALT attributes are descriptive and accurate .</li>
<li>Check for broken links and correct HTML .</li>
<li>If you decide to use dynamic pages (i.e., the URL contains a "?" character), be aware that not every search engine spider crawls dynamic pages as well as static pages. It helps to keep the parameters short and the number of them few. </li>
Review our recommended best practices for images, video and rich snippets.</li>
<h3>Quality guidelines:	</h3>
<p>These quality guidelines cover the most common forms of deceptive or manipulative behavior, but Google may respond negatively to other misleading practices not listed here. It's not safe to assume that just because a specific deceptive technique isn't included on this page, Google approves of it. Webmasters who spend their energies upholding the spirit of the basic principles will provide a much better user experience and subsequently enjoy better ranking than those who spend their time looking for loopholes they can exploit. </p>
<p>If you believe that another site is abusing Google's quality guidelines, please let us know by filing a spam report. Google prefers developing scalable and automated solutions to problems, so we attempt to minimize hand-to-hand spam fighting. While we may not take manual action in response to every report, spam reports are prioritized based on user impact, and in some cases may lead to complete removal of a spammy site from Google's search results. Not all manual actions result in removal, however. Even in cases where we take action on a reported site, the effects of these actions may not be obvious. </p>
<h4>Quality guidelines - basic principles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make pages primarily for users, not for search engines. </li>
<li>Don't deceive your users. </li>
<li>Avoid tricks intended to improve search engine rankings. A good rule of thumb is whether you'd feel comfortable explaining what you've done to a website that competes with you, or to a Google employee. Another useful test is to ask, "Does this help my users? Would I do this if search engines didn't exist?" </li>
<li>Think about what makes your website unique, valuable, or engaging. Make your website stand out from others in your field. </li>

<li>Engage in good practices like the following:Monitoring your site for hacking and removing hacked content as soon as it appears</li>
</ul>
