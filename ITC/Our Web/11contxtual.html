<h1>Display keywords and contextual targeting</h1>
<p>Keywords are part of contextual targeting on the Display Network, which uses the keywords or topics you’ve chosen to match your ads to relevant sites. Sometimes your ads may show on placements that seem unrelated to your Display keywords. In cases like these, it’s possible that your ads are being shown to someone based on their recent browsing history or other factors, rather than the content of the page they’re currently viewing. Learn more about how contextual targeting works on the Display Network</p>
<p>Here are three things you should do when choosing keywords for your Display Network campaigns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create ad groups for your products or services so we can show ads related to them.</li>
<li>Choose keywords that you imagine could appear on a website where your most likely customers might browse . </li>
<li>Get additional ad group and keyword ideas by using Display Planner. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Create ad groups:</h3>
<p>Before you choose keywords for your Display Network campaigns, make sure that the ad groups for each of your campaigns are organized by the products or services that you offer. It's best to start with keywords that describe the products or services that you're advertising. Then, you can create ads related to those keywords, which we can show to customers when they're on websites related to your products or services. You can keep your account better organized by grouping your keywords by the types of websites that potential customers might browse before they’re ready to buy your products or services.</p>

<h5>Example</h5>
<p>Let's say you're building a campaign for your bakery. When you set up your campaign, you should separate your ad groups into the different types of products that you sell.</p>
<p>Here are examples of poorly structured and effectively structured ad groups to get a better idea of how to organize your ad groups:</p>

<h5>Tip</h5>
<p>Add more keywords that are similar to those that are performing well for you.</p>
<h3>Choose keywords:</h3>





<p>Your ad group's keyword list helps us show your ads on relevant websites that your customers visit. Follow these guidelines to create a high-quality keyword list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose keywords related to your product or service. </li>
<li>Create a set of five to 20 keywords that relate closely to one another and to the ads in that ad group. Keywords of two or three words (phrases) tend to work most effectively. </li>
<li>Select keywords that are related to each other. For example, if you sell flowers, you might want to add "roses" and "flower arrangements" to your keyword list. That way, your keywords can show your ads to customers who could be interested in buying roses or flower arrangements for an event. </li>
<li>Select keywords related to the websites your customers see. </li>
<li>If you have a strong and well-recognized brand, include branded keywords. </li>
</ul>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>Ad group: brownies</p>
<p>Keywords: chocolate brownies, dark chocolate brownies, chewy brownies, dessert recipes, brownie recipes</p>
<p>Our technology scans the content and web address of a webpage to determine its central theme. We then automatically use your keywords and topic selections, plus your language and location targeting, and other settings to match the themes to your ads. Sometimes, we might show ads when keywords match the content of pages a person has recently browsed. </p>
<h5>Tips</h5>
<ul>
<li>Try excluding keywords to make sure your ads don't appear on irrelevant websites. </li>
<li>Refine your keyword list by adding or removing keywords. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Get ad group and keyword ideas:</h3>
<p>You can use Display Planner to get themed ad group and keyword ideas that you might not think of when you build your campaigns. Here's how to use Display Planner: </p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Tools tab and select Display Planner. </li>
<li>Enter your customers’ interests or types of landing pages they typically visit. </li>
<li>Click Get ad group ideas. </li>
<li>To see keyword ideas, click the Individual targeting ideas tab and then the Keywords sub-tab. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Monitor and improve your keyword performance:</h3>
<p>To see results metrics for your Display Network keywords, go to the Display tab and click Display keywords. You’ll find a table including impressions, clicks, and other results showing how well your keywords are meeting your advertising goals. </p>
<p>You can also see the websites where your ads were shown based on your Display keywords. On the Placements tab, the summary table shows where your ads showed, how often, how many clicks your ads received and more. Based on the types of websites where your ads perform the best, you can make decisions about expanding or revising your keyword list to match content that’s most relevant for your business. </p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>Basically all engines work on the same basic principles i.e crawling,indexing and searching.In this way google search engine works. </p>
